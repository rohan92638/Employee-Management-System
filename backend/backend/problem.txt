8 — Testing Permissions & Roles (Admin / Manager / Employee)

Create Manager group & assign user

In admin: create a Manager group and add permissions; add user to that group.

Link a User to an Employee instance via employee.user = user.

Test flows

Log in as Admin (superuser) — should access everything.

Log in as Manager — should be able to manage employees in their department (based on permission logic).

Log in as Employee (non-admin) — should only view/edit own record.

Logic: permissions are enforced in permissions.py (object-level checks). If you get 403 Forbidden, verify group membership or Employee.user mapping.
